https://www.tradingview.com/script/FsxCDGWG-SMA-Imbalance-Oscillator/

This oscillator is used for *mean reversion* strategies only.

This oscillator calculates the real-time distance of a price-point subtracted from the SMA , then compares it to the average distance to determine equilibrium imbalances. When the imbalance becomes less and goes under the signal line, a reversal is very likely.

Do not trade mean reversion during any news events.
